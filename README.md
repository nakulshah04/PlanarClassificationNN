# Planar Data Classification with One Hidden Layer 🌸🧠

This project implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer to classify non-linearly separable planar data. It's inspired by DeepLearning.AI's Deep Learning Specialization (Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning) and demonstrates how neural networks can learn complex decision boundaries.

## 📌 Project Overview

The model is trained on a synthetic "flower-shaped" dataset where linear classifiers (like logistic regression) fail. With a hidden layer and non-linear activations, the network learns to correctly classify data points into two classes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Programming language
- **NumPy** – Matrix operations and model implementation
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization of decision boundaries
- **Scikit-learn** – For dataset generation and logistic regression baseline
